#!/usr/bin/env bash
# ledger.sh — append one line to a batch's thin ledger.
#
# The ledger records ONLY facts that gh/git cannot re-derive: a decision the team-lead
# made, an authorization the user gave verbally, a fault the team-lead absorbed, a gap it
# spotted, why an issue was shelved, a merge it performed, a retrospective handed in.
# Everything reconstructable from the remote (issue/PR/branch state, dependency graph)
# stays out — batch-poll.sh recomputes that on demand. Recovery replays this file to
# rebuild what crashed-and-lost context can't, then reconciles against a fresh poll.
#
# Why a script and not `echo '{...}' >> file`: a hand-built line breaks the moment a
# detail string contains a quote or newline, and a malformed line breaks recovery's
# replay. jq builds valid JSON every time, the timestamp is stamped deterministically,
# and the kind is validated so a typo can't silently drop an event from a recovery scan.
#
# USAGE
#   bash ledger.sh <batch-id> <kind> [--issue N] [--pr M] \
#                  [--scope-spec N | --scope-issues "1,2,3"] [--detail "free text"]
#
#   <batch-id>  spec-<N> for a Spec batch, or a slug for an explicit-issue batch (e.g.
#               batch-2026-06-20). Restricted to [A-Za-z0-9._-]; becomes the filename.
#   <kind>      one of: decision | authorization | fault | gap | shelve | merge |
#               retrospective | closed
#
# LINE SCHEMA (one JSON object per line, appended to .afk/<batch-id>.jsonl)
#   {
#     "ts":     "<ISO8601 UTC>",   # stamped here, not by the caller
#     "kind":   "<kind>",
#     "issue":  <int> | null,      # the issue this event concerns, when applicable
#     "pr":     <int> | null,      # the PR this event concerns, when applicable
#     "scope":  {"spec": <int>} | {"issues": [<int>,...]} | null,
#                                  # the batch's membership in machine-readable form, so recovery
#                                  # rebuilds the batch-poll input deterministically instead of parsing
#                                  # free text. Set it on the FIRST line (the plan decision/authorization):
#                                  # --scope-spec <N> for a Spec batch, --scope-issues <csv> for a slug batch
#                                  # (where batch-id alone cannot recover the member set). null otherwise.
#     "detail": "<str>"            # human-readable specifics (the argument/decision/cause)
#   }
#
# LIFECYCLE (the skill drives this; the script only appends)
#   - First append happens when the user confirms the plan (the pre-authorization /
#     plan decision), which also creates .afk/ and the file. This first line MUST carry
#     the batch scope (--scope-spec / --scope-issues, enforced below) so recovery can
#     rebuild the members.
#   - Events append throughout the run.
#   - The batch ends with a `closed` line. The file is NOT deleted — it is the
#     retrospective/audit source, and recovery treats a `closed` line as the terminal
#     marker (a ledger without one is a candidate for resumption).
#
# NOTE: .afk/ is gitignored. This ledger is local operational state, never committed.
