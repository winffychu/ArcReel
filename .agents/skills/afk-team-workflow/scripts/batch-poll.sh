# batch-poll.sh — pull the remote state of a whole AFK batch in one shot.
#
# Sibling in spirit to pr-ai-review-loop/scripts/poll.sh: collect gh/git facts,
# project them mechanically, and leave every semantic call to Claude. This script
# answers "where does each issue physically sit on the remote, right now" so the
# team-lead doesn't hand-expand sub-issues / rebuild the dependency graph each time it
# plans, runs a health check, or recovers a crashed batch.
#
# USAGE
#   bash batch-poll.sh --spec <N>           # expand a Spec's GitHub sub-issues
#   bash batch-poll.sh --issues 1,2,3       # an explicit cross-Spec issue set
#
# OUTPUT: single JSON object to stdout (fatal errors to stderr prefixed
# `BATCH_POLL_ERROR:`; per-issue degradations prefixed `BATCH_POLL_WARN:`).
#
# JSON SCHEMA

#
# stage_hint LADDER (first match wins; purely remote-mechanical, no liveness guess)
#   1. PR MERGED                              -> done
#   2. PR OPEN and not draft                  -> review-loop
#   3. PR is draft, or PR CLOSED unmerged     -> shelved   (this workflow shelves by drafting the PR)
#   4. no PR but remote branch issue/<N>      -> local-review (branch pushed, PR not opened yet)
#   5. no PR, no branch, issue closed/done    -> done       (closed-completed without a PR of its own)
#   6. no PR, no branch, issue closed/other   -> shelved
#   7. otherwise                              -> no-branch  (means ONLY "no remote branch" — NOT "teammate dead")
#
# "## Blocked by" PARSING (mechanical, follows the to-tickets template convention)
#   The dependency graph lives in each issue body's "## Blocked by" section, not in
#   GitHub's native issue-dependency links (this repo leaves those empty). The section
#   is either "None ..." or a list of "- #<N>" items. Rule: take the section's lines up
#   to the next "## " heading; if the first non-empty line starts with "None" (any case)
#   -> blocked_by is []; otherwise collect every #<N> reference in the section. The
#   "None" prefix check is what defends against bodies like
#   "None - can start immediately (prereqs #41/#42 already merged)" — those trailing #refs
#   are merged context, not blockers, so a naive #N grep would wrongly capture them as deps.
#   This is a documented-format projection, not open-ended NLP; the team-lead still reads each
#   body (SKILL.md step 1) and overrides if a human wrote the section unconventionally.
#
# BOUNDARY (hold this line — crossing it turns a fact collector into a semantic judge)
#   - Reports gh/git facts and mechanical roll-ups ONLY.
#   - Does NOT judge whether a teammate is alive/stalled (no-branch is a remote fact, not a verdict).
#   - Does NOT decide whether a PR should merge (merge_candidate is the mechanical "green & mergeable"
#     signal; the merge decision stays with the team-lead, who also weighs the review-looper's report).
#   - Does NOT drill into per-reviewer detail (that is poll.sh's job, one PR at a time).
#   - Does NOT read the .afk ledger (the ledger is replayed by the recovery flow, not by this script).
#
# PITFALLS
#   1. gh pr list --head finds a MERGED PR by head ref even after the branch is deleted, so a
#      finished issue still resolves to stage_hint=done. remote_branch goes false at the same time;
#      that pair (no branch + merged PR) is normal for done work, not a contradiction.
#   2. mergeable/mergeStateStatus read UNKNOWN transiently (GitHub computes them lazily after a push)
#      and on MERGED PRs. A freshly pushed PR can miss merge_candidate for a poll or two — re-run.
#   3. statusCheckRollup mixes CheckRun (status/conclusion) and StatusContext (state, e.g. CodeRabbit,
#      license/cla). Both shapes are checked; metric-only contexts (codecov) count as real checks here,
#      so a red codecov keeps a PR out of merge_candidate — the team-lead overrides knowing it is non-blocking.
#   4. ready_to_start is dependency+stage only; it does NOT subtract ready-for-human. The team-lead intersects
#      it with triage (SKILL.md step 2) — a needs-human issue can be "startable" by deps yet must be skipped.
